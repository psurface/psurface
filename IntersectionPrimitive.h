 * Consider a FE basis function on the nonmortar side and one on the mortar
 * side.  Their supports are sets of simplices on \f$\Gamma_m\f$ resp. \f$\Gamma_n\f$.
 * Pick one simplex from each set.  If their images under the projections
 * \f$\phi_m\f$ resp. \f$\phi_n\f$ overlaps, this overlap will generally be
 * distributed over several simplices of the intermediate surface.  Its
 * restriction to an intermediate surface triangle is a plane convex polygon
 * with no more than six vertices.  Triangulate this polygon and each resulting
 * triangle shall be represented by an IntersectionPrimitive.
